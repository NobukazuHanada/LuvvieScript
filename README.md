  <h1>Hey, Node.js Developers!</h1>
  <p>Did you know that Erlang was a big influence on the design of Node.js?
  </p>
  <p>LuvvieScript is a compile-to-JavaScript dialect of Erlang that runs in the browser. It is a small but interesting early-stage project that will challenge preconceptions about how one should structure large JavaScript applcations. Exploring LuvvieScript will provide deeper insight into why Node.js is structured in the manner that it is.
  </p>
  <p>It's an open source project, so feel free to
  <a href="http://luvvi.ie/getting-started.html">join us</a>!
  Don't worry, you don't need to be an Erlang guru :-) You can jump right in and see how we are
  <a href="http://luvv.ie/toolchain.html">transpiling Erlang to JavaScript</a>.
